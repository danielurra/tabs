# Tabs webapp introduction
The idea behind "Tabs" was to create a tool to be used by Tier2 technicians to make easy to save and retrieve information<br>
Tier2 technicians work with multiple cases (tickets) during the day for each case, they access different portals and collect data<br>
By using Tabs they can now have a place where all the details gathered for on case can be quickly accesible.<br>
The tool feature on text manipularion area that allow you to remove undesired characters, like parenthesis, dashes, colon, etc.
Once you've cleaned up your text the tool will allow you so copy it to clipborad and also save for future reference.
Another useful tool is the rich-text area that allow you to document all the case details and make use of bold, highlight(yellow), lists, etc.

## Future additions
The main addition will be to create a backend with node.js and JWT as the authentication method that will allow visitors to login-in<br>
and be able to resume their job at the same point they left it.
Other minor additions are on the pipe as well but not that relevant at this moment.
