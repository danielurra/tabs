# Tabs webapp introduction
![logo200x200-for-t2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b4137e3-3cc1-4d53-bd99-c3a092ffdc6e)<br>
The idea behind `"Tabs"` was to create a tool for **Tier 2 technicians** that simplifies the process of saving and retrieving information.<br>
Tier 2 technicians handle multiple cases (tickets) throughout the day, accessing different portals and collecting a large amount of data for each case.<br>
With Tabs, they now have a centralized location where all the details gathered for a single case can be quickly accessed.<br>
## Main features
* **Text Manipulation**:
This tool features a `text manipulation area` that allows you to remove undesired characters, such as parentheses, dashes, colons, etc. 
Once you've cleaned up your text, the tool enables you to copy it to the clipboard and save it for future reference.
* **Rich text area**
Another useful feature is the `rich-text area`, which allows you to document all case details while utilizing formatting options like bold, highlighting (in yellow), lists, and more.
* **Image Pasting area**
  Each tab can include images to validate or support the information being addressed in that particular tab. This feature is highly desirable because, without it,
  Tier 2 technicians would need to save images to their hard drives, likely creating a folder for organization. They would then have to remember
  where each image was saved when accessing them the next day. This tool allows quick access to all case details, including images.

## Technology stack
Tabs webapp has been built by using below languages and technologies
### Front End
* vanilla JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
### Back End
Node.js
JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization
## Future additions
The main addition will be to create a backend with node.js and JWT as the authentication method that will allow visitors to login-in<br>
and be able to resume their job at the same point they left it.
Other minor additions are on the pipe as well but not that relevant at this moment.
