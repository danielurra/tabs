# Tabs webapp introduction
The idea behind "Tabs" was to create a tool to be used by the **Tier2 technicians** to make easy to save and retrieve information<br>
Tier2 technicians work with multiple cases (tickets) during the day for each case, they access different portals and collect data<br>
By using Tabs they can now have a place where all the details gathered for on case can be quickly accesible.<br>
## Main features
* Text Manipulation:
The tool feature on text manipularion area that allow you to remove undesired characters, like parenthesis, dashes, colon, etc.
Once you've cleaned up your text the tool will allow you so copy it to clipborad and also save for future reference.
* Rich text area
Another useful tool is the rich-text area that allow you to document all the case details and make use of bold, highlight(yellow), lists, etc.
* Image Pasting area
  Each tab can have images to validate/support whatever is being treated on that particular Tab, this tool is highly desired because otherwise the <br>
  Tier2 technician has to save the images to its harddrive and for that probavly make firt a folder, and to see them the next day remember where that<br>
  image was saved, this tool allows you to quickly access all details of your case included images.

## Future additions
The main addition will be to create a backend with node.js and JWT as the authentication method that will allow visitors to login-in<br>
and be able to resume their job at the same point they left it.
Other minor additions are on the pipe as well but not that relevant at this moment.
