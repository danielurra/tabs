## TABS WebApp Introduction
The idea behind `"Tabs"` was to create a tool for **Tier 2 technicians** that simplifies the process of saving and retrieving information.<br>
Tier 2 technicians handle multiple cases (tickets) throughout the day, accessing different portals and collecting a large amount of data for each case.<br>
With Tabs, they now have a centralized location where all the details gathered for a single case can be quickly accessed.<br>
## Main features
* **Text Manipulation**:
This tool features a `text manipulation area` that allows you to remove undesired characters, such as parentheses, dashes, colons, etc. 
Once you've cleaned up your text, the tool enables you to copy it to the clipboard and save it for future reference.
* **Rich text area**
Another useful feature is the `rich-text area`, which allows you to document all case details while utilizing formatting options like bold, highlighting (in yellow), lists, and more.
* **Image Pasting area**
  Each tab can include images to validate or support the information being addressed in that particular tab. This feature is highly desirable because, without it,
  Tier 2 technicians would need to save images to their hard drives, likely creating a folder for organization. They would then have to remember
  where each image was saved when accessing them the next day. This tool allows quick access to all case details, including images.
  It is quite common you want to be able to save/document both the **before** and **after** of some particular change, this is easily done by saving two images.

## Technology stack
Tabs webapp has been built by using below languages and technologies
### Frontend
* vanilla JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
### Backend (To be determined )
* Node.js or PHP
* JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization
* Database MySQL or Postgre
## Future additions
The main addition will be the creation of a **backend** using `Node.js` with `JWT` as the authentication method.<br>
This will allow visitors to log in and resume their work from the point where they left off. <br>
There are also other minor additions in the pipeline, but they are not as relevant at this moment.<br>
