# Tabs webapp introduction
The idea behind `"Tabs"` was to create a tool for **Tier 2 technicians** that simplifies the process of saving and retrieving information.<br>
Tier 2 technicians handle multiple cases (tickets) throughout the day, accessing different portals and collecting a large amount of data for each case.<br>
With Tabs, they now have a centralized location where all the details gathered for a single case can be quickly accessed.<br>
## Main features
* Text Manipulation:
The tool feature on text manipularion area that allow you to remove undesired characters, like parenthesis, dashes, colon, etc.
Once you've cleaned up your text the tool will allow you so copy it to clipborad and also save for future reference.
* Rich text area
Another useful tool is the rich-text area that allow you to document all the case details and make use of bold, highlight(yellow), lists, etc.
* Image Pasting area
  Each tab can have images to validate/support whatever is being treated on that particular Tab, this tool is highly desired because otherwise the <br>
  Tier2 technician has to save the images to its harddrive and for that probavly make firt a folder, and to see them the next day remember where that<br>
  image was saved, this tool allows you to quickly access all details of your case included images.

The main addition will be to create a backend with node.js and JWT as the authentication method that will allow visitors to login-in<br>
and be able to resume their job at the same point they left it.
